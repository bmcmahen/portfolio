Goals for the website:

1A. A short bio of me with a link to learn more. Maybe use a photo of me that auto clears via the interactive canvas effect.

1. Show 3 different projects that show off my various skills, talking about the background of the project and what sort of problems we solved. List some of the technical specs, perhaps some of the libraries or open source stuff used.

- Watershed, Eugenics Archive, Roast Buddy
- Would be cool if these were animated a bit (like netflix?), maybe interactive (learn more... opens up a shelf like netflix revealing more info?)
- Possibly interactive bullet points

2. Show recent open source (it would be nice if it pulled this in automatically)
3. Show recent blog posts
4. Contact and services.
